some of the sensors found on the Sphero BOLT are compass sensor, ambient light sensor and infrared sensors.
the infrared sensors on sphero BOLT works not ilke a tv infrared. Instead of a single IR emitter (like a TV remote), Sphero BOLT has FOUR! It also has four IR receivers. The four emitters and receivers create 360 of IR communication. This means that Sphero BOLT robots can send and receive messages from each other. That is how it works on sphero infrared works

 The imports to learn code can teach you how computers and phones works and how to fix them.
 If you miss a code detail or put one little wrong you will have a new code or not working code.
 A good habit to develop is a the teacher for help if you have a qustion
